# Brand Coolness Using Sppotify and Song Lyrics
[Full Code](https://github.com/sourwurm/Brand-Coolness-with-Spotify)

I remember being a kid and thinking it was pretty funny that the Supreme Court could refer to corporations as "persons". I recently had that thought again and it made me think, if a corporation can be a person, then why can't a person be a corporation? Needless to say I have now relinquished my humanity.

#### Dav Corp.
So here I am, David Lopez, the corporation. In order to see how Dav Corp. is doing, I'd like to understand how "cool" our brand is to the general public. "Brand Coolness" has been conceptualized many different ways. Though seemingly juvenile, the implications that coolness can have on a brand can be the difference between [Nike](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-nike-defines-cool-2017-3) and [Sketchers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/52mduq/whats_the_most_uncool_brand_or_company/d7lf1t1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). In an article published by [Warren (2019)](http://www.sundigital.uk/Journals-ABS-4star/Brand%20Coolness%20-%20Caleb%20Warren,%20Rajeev%20Batra,%20Sandra%20Maria%20Correia%20Loureiro,%20and%20Richard%20P.%20Bagozzi.pdf) brand coolness was conceptualized to have 10 sepearate criteria"

A cool brand is:
- Extraordinary/Useful: A positive quality that sets a brand apart from its competitors/offering superior functional value
- High Status: Associated with social class, prestige, sophistication, and esteem
- Aesthetically Appealing: Having an attractive and visually pleasing appearance
- Rebellious: A tendency to oppose, fight, subvert, or combat conventions and social norms
- Original: A tendency to be different, creative, and to do things that have not been done before
- Authentic: Behaving in a way that is consistent with or true to its perceived essence or roots
- Subcultural: Associated with an autonomous group of people who are perceived to operate independent from and outside of mainstream society
- Popular: Fashionable, trendy, and liked by most people
- Iconic: Widely recognized as a cultural symbol
- Energetic: Possessing strong enthusiasm, energy, and vigor


Surely Dav Corp. could fit the bill. To see how we measure up to this criteria, we chose to evaluate ourselves based on data provided by Spotify, and lyric data that could be found on Genius.com. Music can tell a lot about an individual (in this case: a corporation). In many ways, music is a reflection of our personalities, so what better way to measure our perceived coolness than with Spotify? Here at Dav Corp., we always strive for success, so we can't just be cool. We must be COOL-ER than the average spotify user. For this reason, I'll be going head-to-head with the top tracks on Spotify to see who comes out on top for coolness.


#### The Spotify API
Spotify's API documentation is amazingly helpful. For our intents and purposes, I decided to look at
