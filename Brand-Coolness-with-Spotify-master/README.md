# Brand-Coolness-with-Spotify
Here I collect data and identify metrics that can be used to identify "coolness" within a brand based off spotify audio features, and song lyric data
"Brand Coolness" has been conceptualized many different ways. In order to evaluate myself, I have chosen to evaluate myself as a brand, using my spotify music data
as metrics to be evaluated by a set criteria. In an article published by [Warren (2019)](http://www.sundigital.uk/Journals-ABS-4star/Brand%20Coolness%20-%20Caleb%20Warren,%20Rajeev%20Batra,%20Sandra%20Maria%20Correia%20Loureiro,%20and%20Richard%20P.%20Bagozzi.pdf), several characteristics were identified to determine brand coolness.

- Extraordinary/Useful: A positive quality that sets a brand apart from its competitors/offering superior functional value
- High Status: Associated with social class, prestige, sophistication, and esteem
- Aesthetically Appealing: Having an attractive and visually pleasing appearance
- Rebellious: A tendency to oppose, fight, subvert, or combat conventions and social norms
- Original: A tendency to be different, creative, and to do things that have not been done before
- Authentic: Behaving in a way that is consistent with or true to its perceived essence or roots
- Subcultural: Associated with an autonomous group of people who are perceived to operate independent from and outside of mainstream society
- Popular: Fashionable, trendy, and liked by most people
- Iconic: Widely recognized as a cultural symbol
- Energetic: Possessing strong enthusiasm, energy, and vigor

Through the Spotify API I was able to identify metrics that could be predictive of these factors, and thus help me determine how cool my theoretical brand is.

Through the work in this project, I was able to identify 5 traits that suggested my "brand" is perceived as cool, 2 that showed I was un-cool, and 3 that are to be determined.
