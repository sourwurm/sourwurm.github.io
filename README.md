## [Brand Coolness Using Spotify and Song Lyrics](/BrandCoolness.md) *(15 min. read)*
Here I collect data and identify metrics that can be used to identify "coolness" within a brand based off spotify audio features, and song lyric data. As a side goal, I sought to develop a framework that could establish a methodology for a web app that will allow users to evaluate themselves by this same criteria, to determine their coolness. In order to evaluate myself, I have chosen to treat myself as a brand by using my spotify music data as performance metrics to be evaluated by a set criteria. I was able to identify 5 traits that suggested my "brand" is perceived as cool, 2 that showed I was un-cool, and 3 that are to be determined. To improve my brand, I should listen to more music that is associated with high status, containing themes that encompass money, status, and iconicity. Additionally, I should listen to more popular music.

## [Health Inspection Score Inflation](/HealthInspections.md) *(10 min. read)*
Going to a restaurant shouldn't result in getting you sick. In examining the Wake County health department's health inspections, I found that as critical health violations increased..... so did health inspection ratings. Not only that, but the common violations are ALSO the ones most often repeated. Violations such as improper food handling, unclean surfaces, and unsafe heating/cooling are all happening on a consistent basis. By looking at trends within the inspectors theselves, I found that some individuals are more likely than others to inflate scores, but this trend is present regardless of experience level. I present Wake County with suggestions to increase objectivity and integrity in ratings in order to provide accurate ratings to underperforming restaurants.

## [Dubai's Public Transit Network](https://github.com/sourwurm/sourwurm.github.io/tree/master/Dubai-Public-Transit-Network-master)
In this notebook I analyze Dubai's vulnerability to both direct and indirect damages resulting from climate change. Most notably is network complexity, which can lead to convoluted bus routes, increased wait times, and increased damage due to high use. I identify several Dubai bus stations that are at high risk of failure due to network complexity, as they carry a high proportion of Dubai RTA's weight. I suggest that Dubai RTA update the infrastructure at these stations, as well as distribute the number of routes that stop at these stations to alleviate load and thus complexity. Such modifications will lead to a climate resilient model of public transportation. 

## [Content Based Recommender](https://github.com/sourwurm/sourwurm.github.io/tree/master/Content_Based_Recommender-master)
In my free time, I like to watch a bit of anime, but with so many shows to choose from it can be hard to pick something to watch. Here, I use a content-based approach towards building an anime recommender. Relevant metrics included a long list of genres, member ratings, and episode length. Once the model was built, I found that my model performed very close to that of the original database that the data was obtained from, despite not having access to user-specific data.
