# [Brand-Coolness-with-Spotify](https://github.com/sourwurm/sourwurm.github.io/tree/master/Brand-Coolness-with-Spotify-master)
Here I collect data and identify metrics that can be used to identify "coolness" within a brand based off spotify audio features, and song lyric data "Brand Coolness" has been conceptualized many different ways. In order to evaluate myself, I have chosen to evaluate myself as a brand, using my spotify music data as metrics to be evaluated by a set criteria. In an article published by Warren (2019), several characteristics were identified to determine brand coolness.

Extraordinary/Useful: A positive quality that sets a brand apart from its competitors/offering superior functional value
High Status: Associated with social class, prestige, sophistication, and esteem
Aesthetically Appealing: Having an attractive and visually pleasing appearance
Rebellious: A tendency to oppose, fight, subvert, or combat conventions and social norms
Original: A tendency to be different, creative, and to do things that have not been done before
Authentic: Behaving in a way that is consistent with or true to its perceived essence or roots
Subcultural: Associated with an autonomous group of people who are perceived to operate independent from and outside of mainstream society
Popular: Fashionable, trendy, and liked by most people
Iconic: Widely recognized as a cultural symbol
Energetic: Possessing strong enthusiasm, energy, and vigor
Through the Spotify API I was able to identify metrics that could be predictive of these factors, and thus help me determine how cool my theoretical brand is.

Through the work in this project, I was able to identify 5 traits that suggested my "brand" is perceived as cool, 2 that showed I was un-cool, and 3 that are to be determined. Results documented in The Verdict

# [Dubai-Public-Transit-Network](https://github.com/sourwurm/sourwurm.github.io/tree/master/Dubai-Public-Transit-Network-master)
In this notebook I analyze Dubai's vulnerability to both direct and indirect damages resulting from climate change. I exemplify temperature and atmospheric pressure findings using a random forest regression model. Most importantly, my analysis of Dubai's public transit network complexity identifies key areas of improvement along the bus system. 

# [Content_Based_Recommender](https://github.com/sourwurm/sourwurm.github.io/tree/master/Content_Based_Recommender-master)
In this project I analyze anime data based on a couple metrics such as rating, genre and type. I then visualize anime based on differences in genre, and measure significance of variance across rating means and total episode counts. Lastly, I end with a content-based recommender that takes into account an anime's genres, episode counts, rating, and the number of members that left a review. The model works to compare these features through cosine similarity.

# [Health Inspection Score Inflation](https://github.com/sourwurm/sourwurm.github.io/blob/master/individual_sp20-master/final_project/FinalProject_sourwurm.ipynb)

In this notebook, I investigate the Wake County health department's health inspections. Through visualization and exploratory analysis, I showcase that health inspection scores are likely being subjected to inflation. This inflation can stem from several sources, but I identify that inspectors themselves may be directly responsible for this phenomenon. Additionally, I uncover that health violations that are most often corrected during the inspection, are also the most likely to be consistently repeated.

This signifies a lack of objectivity in grading criteria, and perhaps a low effectiveness in health inspections. Future inspection guidelines should work to preserve integrity, and emphasize a non-arbitrary grading system.
