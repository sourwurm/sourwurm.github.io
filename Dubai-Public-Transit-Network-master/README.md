# Dubai-Public-Transit-Network
In this notebook I analyze Dubai's vulnerability to both direct and indirect damages resulting from climate change. I exemplify temperature and atmospheric pressure findings using a random forest regression model. Most importantly, my analysis of Dubai's public transit network complexity identifies key areas of improvement along the bus system. Please note: This was all done as practice and any feedback that can help me grow is of course welcome!

Thank you Jeffrey Uguchukwu for letting me bounce ideas off you for the random forest.
